# Space Rocks

## This is my first project in Game Maker Studio 2 (GMS), using the tutorial for game development.

### This project uses Game Maker Language (GML), and does not use Drag and Drop (DnD). It follows along with all of the video tutorial while adding some of my own twists.

#### ALL Sprites are custom made by me. Original Sprite designs may be found in links on the tutorial.

#### Background music is custom made by me as well! I am not musician haha...
