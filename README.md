# Space Rocks

## This is my first project in Game Maker Studio 2 (GMS), using the tutorial for game development.

### This project uses Game Maker Language (GML), and does not use Drag and Drop (DnD). As such, I do not know if it can be converted back into DnD, but that is on GMS.

#### ALL Sprites are custom made by me. Original Sprite designs may be found in links on the tutorial.
